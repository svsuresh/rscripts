# R scripts

This repository holds the miscellaneous R scripts I wrote. Please note that these scripts as provided such and execute appropriate precaution in using them. You can better them and share them with the community. At first these scripts are R scripts. Eventually I will move them to Rmark up.

Scripts:
1.  	Volcano plot using ggplot2.Rmd - This script is for volcano plots in ggplot2 and basic R plotting for highlighting genes/points of interest
2. salmon_deseq2 workflow.Rmd - This script is analyzing Salmon output using DESEQ2 R library. Output from Salmon output should be in a folder by name "results" and the transcript mapping file should be in "reference" folder. Script (salmon_deseq2 workflow.Rmd), results folder and reference folder should be in the same folder. Output from the analysis (salmon_deseq2 workflow.Rmd output) will be stored in a separate folder (salmon_deseq2_results_results) in results folder. User should edit the sample names and subsequent processing by hand. This script, will generate DE genes, produces DESEQ2 results report in html and pdf format. In addition, same information is captured in a separate pdf. User can edit the params to get optimal images. 
3. wasabi_sleuth_workflow.Rmd - This script is analyzing Salmon output using Wasabi and Sleuth R libraries. Output from Salmon output should be in a folder by name "results" and the transcript mapping file should be in "reference" folder. Script (wasabi_sleuth_workflow.Rmd), results folder and reference folder should be in the same folder. Output from the analysis (wasabi_sleuth_workflow.Rmd output) will be stored in a separate folder (sleuth_results) in results folder. User should edit the sample names and subsequent processing by hand. This script, will generate DE genes.
4. time_series_ggplot_30052018.Rmd - This script is for plotting time series gene expression data with two conditions (treated vs untreated). You can view the output below: ![here](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ro4WbMfqWU4/Ww5rsc_p5OI/AAAAAAAABDM/w411-QoLBiYw3ZJLOD-rVazGqoNIEbkHwCLcBGAs/s1600/Rplot02.png)  ![here](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sbcahB8aeHY/Ww5ryxfl7mI/AAAAAAAABDQ/gUr47aZAPBAuzhI0M6_dYaTa8dHkC6lUwCEwYBhgL/s1600/Rplot.png)
5. average_triplicates.Rmd. This script averages (mean) triplicate columns. Format for triplicates is samplename_timepoint_Replicatenumber (for eg. X_T0_R1,X_T0_R2,X_T0_R3 - 3 replicates for time 0 for x, X_T1_R1,X_T1_R2,X_T1_R3 - three replicates for time 1 for x)
