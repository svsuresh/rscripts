# R scripts

This repository holds the miscellaneous R scripts I wrote. Please note that these scripts as provided such and execute appropriate precaution in using them. You can better them and share them with the community. At first these scripts are R scripts. Eventually I will move them to Rmark up.

Scripts:
1. ggplot2.Rmd - This script is for volcano plots in ggplot2 and basic R plotting for highlighting genes/points of interest
